# Dictionnaire-Francais
Sooooo this is adictionary with a lot of cool features I'm going to add. Why I am doing this?
-Want to learn SQL
-Want to learn French
-Most dictionaries are lacking something

#Verbs (dont je m'occupe):
-conjugation tables for all tenses
-default conjugations which can be overrided by irregular verbs

#Nouns:
-Masculin or Feminin article 
-Machine learning algorithm for telling whether masc/fem autimation(python)

#Definition:
Since I'm a B1 in french I'm looking to move away from english translations. Instead I will create 'word networks', i.e words that means the same or similar things to each other. This network can have a variable degree distance.
E.g
3 verbs A, B ,C  we have A ~~ B and B ~~ C. seting degree(1) at A => similarWords(A) = {B}
						   degree(2) at A => similarWords(A) = {B, C}
